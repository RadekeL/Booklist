# Booklist
The application saves all read books in the form of cards.In the project I've used chart.js to visualize reading statistics based on stored data. Booklist is based on Resposive Web Design (Mobile first).

This project includes technologies such as:
  - Sass,
  - Webpack,
  - EsLint,
  - Git,
