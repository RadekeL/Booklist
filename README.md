## Status
Project is:  in progress
Currently I’ve  stopped  developing the project. I‘ve done the MVP and decided to learn new skills by starting new projects. The project hasn’t been finished yet. There are still a lot of areas to be developed and functionalities to be improved. I will come back to the project in the nearest future.

## Inspiration
While building this app the most inspiring factor was a project released on youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMCxVWtW58. It shows how to build a simple booklist app without frameworks base on vanilla JS. I decided to develop the idea and implement new features based on my previous experience and skills.
